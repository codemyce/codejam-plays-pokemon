# codejam-plays-pokemon
Codejam 2019 project from a 36 hour hackathon

# Requirements
Need to install the libraries outlined in the requirements doc. Simply run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This code was designed to run on windows.
This program uses wrnchAI SDK. In order to use that, a license and account is required through them. In addition, the wrnch\src\wrSamples\python\*, wrnch\lib\python\3.7\*, and wrnch\bin\*.dll must be copied into this root directory.

In addition, this code needs a target. Currently that is an emulator that's hard-coded in. This project uses bsnes and has that located in a nearby folder
